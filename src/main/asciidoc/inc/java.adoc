[[funktion-java]]

= Using funktion on the JVM

Funktion is designed so that it can bind any events to any HTTP endpoint or any function source using a scripting language like nodejs, python or ruby. But you can also embed the funktion mechanism inside a JVM process.


To do that you:

* write a simple function in any programming language https://github.com/funktionio/funktion-connectors/blob/master/funktion-runtime/src/test/java/io/fabric8/funktion/sample/Main.java#L25-L27[like this].

* create a link:funktion-runtime/funktion.yml[funktion.yml] file and associate your function with an http://camel.apache.org/components.html[event trigger endpoint URL] such as a HTTP URL or email address to listen on, a message queue name or database table etc.

* build and deploy the Java project in the usual way, such as via http://fabric8.io/guide/cdelivery.html[Jenkins CI / CD pipeline] and your funktion will be deployed to your kubernetes cluster!

== Examples

Check out the following example projects which use a JVM and implement the functions in different JVM based languages:

* https://github.com/fabric8-quickstarts/funktion-java-example[funktion-java-example] is an example using a Java funktion triggered by HTTP
* https://github.com/fabric8-quickstarts/funktion-groovy-example[funktion-groovy-example] is an example using a http://www.groovy-lang.org/[Groovy] funktion triggered by HTTP
* https://github.com/fabric8-quickstarts/funktion-kotlin-example[funktion-kotlin-example] is an example using a https://kotlinlang.org/[Kotlin] funktion triggered by HTTP


== Getting started with Funktion and the JVM

You can just fork one of the above examples and use command line tools to build and deploy it to a http://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes] or https://www.openshift.org/[OpenShift] cluster.

However to make it easier to create, build, test, stage, approve, release, manage and iterate on your funktion code from inside your browser we recommend you use the http://fabric8.io/[Fabric8 Microservices Platform] with its baked in http://fabric8.io/guide/cdelivery.html[Continuous Delivery] based on https://jenkins.io/solutions/pipeline/[Jenkins Pipelines] together with integrated http://fabric8.io/guide/console.html[Developer Console], http://fabric8.io/guide/management.html[Management] (centralised logging, metrics, alerts), http://fabric8.io/guide/chat.html[ChatOps] and http://fabric8.io/guide/chaosMonkey.html[Chaos Monkey].

When using the http://fabric8.io/[Fabric8 Microservices Platform] you can create a new funktion in a few clicks from the `Create Application` button; then the platform takes care of building, testing, staging and approving your releases, rolling upgrades, management and monitoring; you just use your browser via the http://fabric8.io/guide/console.html[Developer Console] to create, edit or test your code while funktion, Jenkins and Kubernetes take care of building, packaging, deploying, testing and releasing your project.

=== Using the Fabric8 Microservices Platform

First you will need to install the http://fabric8.io/[fabric8 microservices platform] on a cluster of http://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes] (1.2 or later) or https://www.openshift.org/[OpenShift] (3.2 or later).

* follow one of the http://fabric8.io/guide/getStarted/index.html[fabric8 getting started guides] to get the http://fabric8.io/[fabric8 microservices platform] up and running on a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster
* open the http://fabric8.io/guide/console.html[Developer Console]
* select your `Team Dashboard` page

=== Create and use your funktion

* from inside your `Team Dashboard` page click `Create Application` button then you will be presented with a number of different kinds of microservice to create
* select the `Funktion` icon and type in the name of your microservice and hit `Next`

* select the kind of funktion you wish to create (Java, Groovy, Kotlin, NodeJS etc) then hit `Next`
* you will now be prompted to choose one of the default CD Pipelines to use. For your first funktion we recommend `CanaryReleaseAndStage`
* selecting `Copy pipeline to project` is kinda handy if you want to edit your `Jenkinsfile` from your source code later on

* click `Next` then your app should be built and deployed. Please be patient first time you build a funktion as its going to be downloading a few docker images to do the build and runtime. You're second build should be much faster!
* once the build is complete you should see on the `App Dashboard` page the build pipeline run, the running pods for your funktion in each environment for your CD Pipeline and a link so you can easily navigate to the environment or ReplicaSet/ReplicationController/Pods in kubernetes
* in the screenshot below you can see we're running version `1.0.1` of the app `groovyfunktion` which currently has `1` running pod (those are all clickable links to view the ReplicationController or pods)
* for HTTP based funktions you can invoke the funktion via the open icon in the `Staging` environment (the icon to the right of the green `1` button next to `groovyfunction-1: 1.0.1`)

=== How it works

When you implement your *Funktion* using a JVM based language like Java, Groovy, Kotlin or Scala then your function is packaged up into a http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] application using http://camel.apache.org/[Apache Camel] to implement the trigger via the various http://camel.apache.org/components.html[endpoint URLs].

We've focussed `funktion` on being some simple declarative metadata to describe triggers via URLs and a simple programming model which is the only thing funktion developers should focus on; leaving the implementation free to use different approaches for optimal resource usage.

The creation of the docker images and generation of the kubernetes manifests is all done by the https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-maven-plugin[fabric8-maven-plugin] which can work with pure docker on Kubernetes or reuse OpenShift's binary source to image builds. Usually this is hidden from you if you are using the http://fabric8.io/guide/cdelivery.html[Continuous Delivery] in the http://fabric8.io/[fabric8 microservices platform]; but if you want to play with funktion purely from the command line, you'll need to https://java.com/en/download/help/index_installing.xml[install Java] and https://maven.apache.org/install.html[install Apache Maven].

Underneath the covers a http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/deployments/[Kubernetes Deployment] is automatically created for your Funktion (or on OpenShift a https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/deployments.html[DeploymentConfig] is used) which takes care of scaling your funktion and performing http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/rolling-updates/[rolling updates] as you edit your code.
