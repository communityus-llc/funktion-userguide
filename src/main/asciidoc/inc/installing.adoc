[[install]]

= Installing Funktion

To use `funktion` you will need a http://kubernetes.io/[kubernetes] or https://www.openshift.org/[openshift] cluster.

If you are on your laptop a quick way to get a kubernetes cluster is by https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#installation[installing and starting minikube] and then http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/prereqs/[installing kubectl] and putting it on your `PATH` environment variable.

To test your kubernetes cluster type the following commands which should succeed without error:

[source]
----
kubectl get node
kubectl get pod
----

[[install-binary]]
== Install the funktion binary

You will also need to https://github.com/funktionio/funktion/releases[download the funktion binary for your platform] and add it to your `PATH` environment variable.

You can test its installed by typing the following in a command shell

[source]
----
funktion version
----

The funktion binary is self updating so you can upgrade your binary to newer versions if they are available via the following command:

[source]
----
funktion update
----

[[install-platform]]
== Installing the Funktion Platform

To install the funktion platform into your current kubernetes namespace:

[source]
----
funktion install platform
----

You can watch the funktion operator pod start via:

[source]
----
kubectl get pod -w
----

=== Using Funktion with the Fabric8 Developer Platform

If you are using the https://fabric8.io/[fabric8 developer platform] then the https://github.com/fabric8io/exposecontroller/[exposecontroller] and  https://github.com/fabric8io/configmapcontroller/[configmapcontroller] microservices will already be installed. So you don't need to install them again.

So to install the funktion operator just type:

[source]
----
funktion install operator
----

[[add-flow-connectors]]
== Add flow connectors

Once you have the platform installed you may wish to install some connectors. For example to install the timer and twitter connectors try:

[source]
----
funktion install connector timer twitter
----

That will install `timer` and `twitter` connectors so that you can use them inside flows.

To see a list of all the connectors available type:

[source]
----
funktion install connector --list
----

To install all the connectors type:

[source]
----
funktion install connector --all
----

Note that installing a connector just creates a kubernetes `ConfigMap` resource; no containers are created until you use the connector in a flow.
